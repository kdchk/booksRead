####SimpleApp.cs
Creating simple application using Notepad.exe and csc.exe

To compile SimpleApp:

1. Download .Net framework SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/net/default.aspx or https://msdn.microsoft.com/aa496123 for example);
2. run csc.exe (in my case, easiest way to do that is to Win+S "Developer Command Prompt for VS2015");
3. change directory, from default to folder with SimpleApp inside, by using command 'cd' (for example 'cd D:\SimpleAppFolder');
4. compile SimpleApp by using command 'csc SimpleApp.cs'.
